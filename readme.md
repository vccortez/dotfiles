# vekat's dotfiles

I maintain my dotfiles with a bare git repository using the `$HOME` directory as a work tree.

To use these files with the same setup, check out [this gist script](https://gist.github.com/vekat/bed1ffeb0f89d04a15ea75d79204ca80). Or just symlink the files to the appropriate folder.

It **requires** git.
